## 🚀 What is J.A.R.V.I.S?

**J.A.R.V.I.S (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System)** is an advanced, real-time AI assistant that listens, understands, speaks, executes tasks, teaches concepts, generates code, and displays information using a clean HUD-style interface.

Designed as a fully interactive AI agent, it behaves and responds like a real digital assistant — not just a chatbot.

## 🧠 Key Features

### 🎤 **Real-Time Voice Interaction**
- Wakeword: **"Jarvis"**  
- Responds instantly to voice commands  
- Auto-mutes mic to avoid self-triggering  

### 🧩 **Code Snippet Mode**
- Ask: *“show me an example in C/Java/Python”*  
- Jarvis generates clean, runnable code with explanations  
- Follow-up questions refine the same snippet  

### 🔍 **Research Mode**
- Ask: *“research on AI”*, *“find info on OSI model”*  
- Jarvis fetches structured research summaries using Groq  

### 📘 **Teaching Mode**
- Ask: *“teach me C language”* or *“explain arrays simply”*  
- Jarvis uses analogies to teach like a guide or tutor  

### 🎬 **Cinematic Identity**
Ask: *“Who are you?”*  
→ Jarvis reveals a cinematic system introduction panel.
