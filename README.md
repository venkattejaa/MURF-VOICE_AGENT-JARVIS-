## 🚀 What is J.A.R.V.I.S?

**J.A.R.V.I.S (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System)** is an advanced, real-time AI assistant that listens, understands, speaks, executes tasks, teaches concepts, generates code, and displays information using a clean HUD-style interface.

Designed as a fully interactive AI agent, it behaves and responds like a real digital assistant — not just a chatbot.

Powered by Murf FALCON TTS for low-latency natural voice output 

### 🧩 **Code Snippet Mode**
- Ask: *“show me an example in C/Java/Python”*  
- Jarvis generates clean, runnable code with explanations  
- Follow-up questions refine the same snippet  

### 🔍 **Research Mode**
Ask:
“Research on AI”
“Find information about OSI Model”
Jarvis:
